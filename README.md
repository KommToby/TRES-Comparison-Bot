# TRES-Comparison-Bot
TRES (Taiko Rework ELO System) Is a project co-ordinated by Lawtron and mangomizer to get a general idea of what a "Perfect World" SR system for taiko would be. This is achieved by taking hundreds of data points from a pool of taiko players from varied skill levels. Their job is to compare pre-chosen taiko maps and give their opinion on which map is more difficult.
