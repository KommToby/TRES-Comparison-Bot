# TRES-Comparison-Bot
TRES (Taiko RR ELO System) Is a project co-ordinated by Lawtron and mangomizer to get a general idea of what a "Perfect World" SR system for taiko would be. This is achieved by taking hundreds of data points from a pool of taiko players from varied skill levels. Their job is to compare pre-chosen taiko maps and give their opinion on which map is more difficult.

## Commands
`-link`: Links your discord account to your osu! account  
`-start`: Starts a taiko map comparison (also works as a skip command)  
`-playstyle`: Adds your playstyle to the database (optional)  
`-harder`: Picks the order of maps from hardest to easiest  
`-skip`: Skips the current comparison and generates a new one  
`-confirm`: Confirms that the maps you have selected are in the right order  
`-elo`: Sets your target star rating for maps you want to compare (after ELO)
